					About Terpenoids
				</h2>
				<p>
					Terpenoids are involved in interactions as signaling
					for communication intra/inter species, signal molecules to attract
					pollinating insects, and defense against herbivores and microbes.
					Due to their chemical composition, many terpenoids possess
					vast pharmacological applicability in medicine and biotechnology,
					besides important roles in ecology, industry and commerce.
				</p>
				<p>
					The biosynthesis of terpenes has been widely studied over the
					years, and it is well known that they can be synthesized from
					two metabolic pathways: mevalonate pathway (MVA) and non-
					mevalonate pathway (MEP). On the other hand, genome-scale 
					reconstruction of metabolic networks faces many challenges,
					including organizational data storage and data modeling, to
					properly represent the complexity of systems biology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recent NoSQL database paradigms have introduced new concepts of
					scalable storage and data queries. Among them graph databases,
					which are versatile enough to cope with biological data. In this
					paper, we propose 2Path, a graph database model designed
					to represent terpenoid metabolic networks, with thousands of
					secondary metabolism reactions, such that it preserves important
					terpenoid biosynthesis characteristics.
